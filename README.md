# NativeShell
Command line interface for Windows Native Mode.
It can perform some basic operations with Windows files and directories. 
Program runs before starting of main Windows components, so it has access to the entire file system and registry without many restrictions. 
All operations are implemented through the Native API (ntdll.dll). 

The sources are based on NCLI (Native Command Line Interface) from the TinyKRNL Project. A code from ZenWINX library partially used.
